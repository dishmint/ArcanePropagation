# Arcane Propagation

* Import an image
* Create a convolution kernel for each neighborhood
* Each frame convolve the source image
* Display the resultant image with dots for each pixel, where:
	* the pixel color determines the dot color
	* the pixel color determines the degree of rotation of the dot around the pixel's origin
