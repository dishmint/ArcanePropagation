In convolution, the kernel elements are typically designed to sum up to 1 to preserve the overall intensity of the image. One way to achieve this is by dividing each pixel's value by the total number of elements in the kernel, which is indeed the square of the kernel width (assuming a square kernel). However, this is not always the case, and the divisor depends on the purpose and design of the kernel.

When you change the divisor, you affect the final output of the convolution operation. Let's see how this impacts the convolution:

Divisor > kernel sum: If the divisor is greater than the sum of the kernel elements, the output image will appear darker. The pixel values will be reduced, leading to lower intensity values.

Divisor < kernel sum: If the divisor is smaller than the sum of the kernel elements, the output image will appear brighter. The pixel values will be increased, leading to higher intensity values.

Divisor = kernel sum: If the divisor is equal to the sum of the kernel elements, the output image will have approximately the same overall brightness as the original image. This is desirable in many applications, such as blurring, sharpening, or edge detection, where you want to maintain the original intensity levels.

It's important to note that these observations are generalizations, and the actual results will depend on the specific kernel values and the input image. In some cases, you might want to use a kernel where the elements sum up to 0 (e.g., edge detection) or have a different sum based on the desired effect. In such cases, the divisor may not be equal to the kernel width squared, and you would have to use a different divisor based on the specific kernel design.

In summary, changing the divisor affects the intensity of the output image in the convolution process. Depending on the purpose of the convolution, you may need to adjust the divisor to achieve the desired effect.
